# Requirements Document

## Introduction

DailyBet AI is a public web application that provides a single, ML-powered "Bet of the Day" recommendation. The system leverages machine learning to analyze multiple data sources (odds, injuries, weather, team momentum, etc.) to select the highest expected value bet each day. Visitors can view the daily pick and track the ML algorithm's performance over time through a clean, responsive interface. The application runs entirely on Vercel with Supabase for database management, using Python for the ML selection logic.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see today's single best betting recommendation with clear details, so that I can make an informed decision about placing the bet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses the home page THEN the system SHALL display today's pick with team, market, odds, and confidence percentage
2. WHEN displaying today's pick THEN the system SHALL include a brief rationale explaining the selection
3. IF no pick exists for today THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message with guidance
4. WHEN showing the pick THEN the system SHALL display the ML algorithm's current win rate and record to date (e.g., "24-10, 70.6%")

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to track the ML algorithm's performance over time, so that I can evaluate the system's accuracy and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses the performance page THEN the system SHALL display a table of all past ML picks with their outcomes
2. WHEN displaying performance data THEN the system SHALL show the algorithm's win rate, total wins, losses, and pushes
3. WHEN showing historical performance THEN the system SHALL include a visual chart of the ML algorithm's cumulative win rate over time
4. WHEN a pick result is settled THEN the system SHALL update all performance metrics to reflect the algorithm's accuracy

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to settle bet outcomes and manage the ML model, so that I can maintain accurate performance tracking and system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin user accesses admin functions THEN the system SHALL provide options to settle bet results
2. WHEN settling a bet result THEN the system SHALL accept win, loss, or push outcomes
3. WHEN an admin triggers model recomputation THEN the system SHALL re-run the ML selection process
4. IF a user lacks admin privileges THEN the system SHALL deny access to administrative functions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As the system, I want to automatically generate daily betting recommendations using ML analysis, so that visitors receive timely, data-driven picks without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the daily cron job executes THEN the system SHALL fetch current games, odds, and contextual data
2. WHEN processing daily data THEN the ML service SHALL analyze multiple feature sources (odds movements, team form, weather, injuries)
3. WHEN the ML model completes analysis THEN the system SHALL select the single highest expected value bet meeting minimum odds thresholds
4. WHEN a pick is generated THEN the system SHALL store it with confidence score, rationale, and timestamp
5. IF the ML service fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide fallback behavior

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As the system, I want to securely manage API endpoints and administrative operations, so that sensitive operations are protected while allowing public access to picks and performance data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visitors access pick and performance data THEN the system SHALL allow public read access without authentication
2. WHEN the cron job calls protected endpoints THEN the system SHALL validate secret tokens
3. WHEN administrative operations are performed THEN the system SHALL require proper authorization
4. IF unauthorized access to admin functions is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny the request and log the attempt

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As the ML service, I want to process multiple data sources efficiently, so that I can generate accurate betting recommendations within serverless execution limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ML service receives a request THEN it SHALL process odds data, team statistics, weather conditions, and injury reports
2. WHEN analyzing betting opportunities THEN the system SHALL focus on moneyline markets initially
3. WHEN calculating recommendations THEN the ML model SHALL output probabilities and select the highest expected value option
4. WHEN returning results THEN the service SHALL include the pick, market, odds, confidence percentage, and top contributing factors
5. IF processing exceeds time limits THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation with simpler models

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to deploy seamlessly to Vercel with proper scheduling, so that the system runs reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL configure cron jobs to run daily at 9:00 AM America/Denver timezone
2. WHEN the cron job executes THEN it SHALL call the protected daily-pick API endpoint
3. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL securely access Supabase and external API keys
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages for troubleshooting
